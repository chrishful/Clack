My contributions involve making ClackServer.java, MessageClackData.java, TestClackServer.java, and parts of TestClackData
to test out MessageClackData and the inherited methods from ClackData. I also set up the github repo, and worked on merging
our own seperate branches. I also did the diagram, wrote up the report, and generated the javadoc. 

Chris worked on ClackClient.java, FileClackData.java, ClackData.java, TestClackClient, and TestClackData to test out FileClackData.
He also set up the project itself in intelliJ.
